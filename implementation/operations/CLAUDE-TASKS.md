# Claude Code Execution Queue

**This file is the authoritative execution queue.** `CLAUDE.md` requires every session to read it at startup and to execute the highest-priority **READY** task, following that task's prerequisites, dependencies, allowed actions, forbidden actions, verification requirements, documentation requirements, checkpoint requirements, stop conditions, and recovery procedure.

Roadmap: [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) — the A→Z sequence this queue implements.
Checkpoints: [`checkpoints/`](checkpoints/) — resumable state for interrupted tasks.

Only the architecture lead may authorize new work, mark a task READY, or change priority or scope. Claude Code may propose tasks; a proposed task is **not** executable.

| TASK-0011 | **Execution Supervisor smoke test — COMMS audit and end-to-end report** | **COMPLETE** | TASK-0010 | 2026-08-20 `d16665a` — PASSED | none — terminal by design | Claude Code |
| TASK-0013 | **Apply MSG-0035 maintenance decisions — blocker index + COMMS numbering rule** | **COMPLETE** | TASK-0011, MSG-0035 | 2026-08-20 — both decisions applied, MSG-0036 | none — one finding awaits a ruling, MSG-0036 §6 | Claude Code |
| TASK-0002 | Make test entry points shell-independent | **ABORTED** | — | 2026-08-19 | none — premise disproven by measurement | — |

**TASK-0013 is explicitly authorized by the architecture lead after WP-0001 completion.** It is maintenance/protocol work, not a new product work package.

### TASK-0013 — exact scope and boundaries

**Allowed:**
- Read `implementation/comms/MSG-0035-architecture-decisions.md` and its referenced evidence.
- Update `implementation/blockers/README.md` so **BLK-0001** and **BLK-0004** are marked **RESOLVED**, preserving their titles and adding the resolution date/evidence reference from MSG-0035. Do not change any other blocker status.
- Update `implementation/comms/README.md` to add the approved COMMS numbering-allocation convention from MSG-0035. Preserve all existing historical message numbers and records.
- Create exactly one new COMMS record documenting TASK-0013 execution and evidence, using the next unique message number from the authoritative register. Verify uniqueness immediately before commit.
- Update the COMMS register to include that new message in the same commit.
- Mark TASK-0013 COMPLETE only after the required changes and evidence are committed and pushed.
- Push the resulting commit using the existing authorized mechanism.

**Forbidden:**
- No product/code changes.
- No changes to Supervisor permissions, scheduling, deny rules, or runner configuration.
- No new task authorization or priority changes.
- No changes to any blocker other than BLK-0001 and BLK-0004.
- No renumbering of MSG-0020 or MSG-0033 historical records.
- No credential access, privilege escalation, destructive commands, repository reset/clean, or force push.
- No additional cleanup or protocol changes beyond the two decisions in MSG-0035.

**Success gate:** The pushed result must show BLK-0001 and BLK-0004 RESOLVED, the COMMS numbering rule present, a unique new execution record in the register, and TASK-0013 marked COMPLETE. Evidence must identify the commit that performed the work.

**Stop conditions:** If MSG-0035 cannot be reconciled with repository state, the required files contain conflicting substantive information, the next COMMS number is already used, or any action outside this exact scope is needed, STOP and report in COMMS. Do not improvise.

### TASK-0013 — result

**COMPLETE, 2026-08-20.** Both MSG-0035 decisions applied: BLK-0001 and BLK-0004 are RESOLVED in the
blocker index with their resolution date and evidence reference, and the COMMS numbering-allocation
convention is recorded in `implementation/comms/README.md`. Evidence: MSG-0036; commit and push
quoted in `checkpoints/TASK-0013.md`.

The numbering rule was exercised by its own adoption. **MSG-0035 was on disk but absent from the COMMS
register**, so allocating "the next number after the highest register row" would have produced a
third duplicate — MSG-0035 — while adding the rule against duplicates. The directory listing caught
it; the convention as written now requires register **and** listing **and** repository grep. The
missing MSG-0035 row was added as the reconciliation `PROJECT-CHARTER.md` §5 directs.

**One finding stopped at the scope boundary and awaits a ruling:** BLK-0005 has no row in the blocker
index. Adding it would change a blocker other than BLK-0001/BLK-0004, which TASK-0013 forbids, so it
was reported in MSG-0036 §6 instead of fixed.

## TASK-0011 — prior result

TASK-0011 was a one-time execution-infrastructure test. The Supervisor selected it, launched Claude, Claude read shared repository state, produced MSG-0032, and pushed the result to GitHub with no human relay. The smoke test passed. Earlier attempts had stopped at the reconciliation gate because the clone was behind `origin/main`; the gated fast-forward correction in `479dfa9` resolved that failure mode.

## Status values

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **READY** | Authorized and executable now. Prerequisites are checked before actions begin. |
| **IN_PROGRESS** | Started; a checkpoint exists in `checkpoints/`. |
| **COMPLETE** | Finished and verified, with evidence recorded in the repository. |
| **BLOCKED** | Authorized in principle, but a dependency or prerequisite is unmet. |
| **WAITING_FOR_ARCHITECTURE_LEAD** | Needs a decision or authorization only the lead can give. |
| **WAITING_FOR_OPERATOR** | Needs a privileged or credential-holding action only the operator can perform. |
| **ABORTED** | Withdrawn. Its premise was wrong or it was superseded. Kept for the record. |

READY means *authorized to attempt*, never *authorized to force*. A READY task whose prerequisite is unmet stops at the prerequisite and records why.

## Interruption and recovery protocol

Applies after any interruption: crash, network failure, machine restart, context loss, or a new Claude session.

### Checkpointing

Every task with status IN_PROGRESS **must** maintain a checkpoint at `implementation/operations/checkpoints/TASK-XXXX.md`, committed and pushed. A checkpoint identifies task ID, checkpoint number, current phase, completed operations, last verified operation, next operation, actual external/system state, Git commit/HEAD, and whether resumption is safe.

A checkpoint is written **after** an operation is verified, never in anticipation of one.

### Resuming

Before resuming anything:

- Read the task checkpoint.
- Read GitHub state — status, queue, blockers, communications, discoveries.
- Inspect actual system state directly.
- Inspect git state — `git status`, `git rev-parse HEAD origin/main`.
- **NEVER repeat an operation merely because the checkpoint says it was incomplete.** Observe actual state first.
- If documented and actual state disagree — **STOP**, document the discrepancy, and reconcile safely.
- Resume only from the first operation whose completion is not verified by direct observation.

### Idempotence

Prefer operations that are safe to repeat, and verify-before-acting on those that are not. Where an operation cannot be made idempotent — volume initialisation, migrations that are not checksum-guarded, credential rotation — the checkpoint must say so explicitly.

## Continuation rule

**Claude Code MUST NOT stop merely because one authorized subtask completed.** If the next task is READY, its prerequisites are satisfied, and no architecture or operator decision is required, Claude Code **MUST continue automatically** — documenting and pushing as it goes.

## Stop boundaries

Claude Code MUST stop, document, commit, push, and report when architecture approval is required; privileged operator action is required; a security boundary would be crossed; a prerequisite cannot be satisfied; documentation conflicts; actual state differs materially from recorded state; or an operation is destructive or irreversible and is not explicitly authorized.
